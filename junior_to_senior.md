A few thoughts on the bullet points found in the book The Coding Career Handbook by Shawn Swyx Wang.

# Code

- Juniors collect solutions. Seniors collect patterns.
    - Mostly, it's a good thing to remember the correct and effective solution for a problem. Upon creating something
      new, no previous solution can be fitted perfectly for the problem. Therefore, underlying ideas, structures and
      patterns should be also in focus when facing a solution for any problem.


- Juniors get code working. Seniors keep code working.
    - It's one thing to get something to work for the first time (see jupyter notebooks)
      and its another big step to get it working reliably during continuous requirement changes (see complex projects).


- Juniors deliver features. Seniors deliver outcomes.
    - A jira ticket for a feature request might not represent well the need behind it. Understanding the true
      requirements are necessary in order to implement the right features.


- Juniors fix bugs after they create them. Seniors create tooling to preclude bugs.
    - Making sure the recently generated code works well is 100 times easier than making sure an older implementation is
      bug-free. Continuously appearing manual overviews should be automated.


- Juniors write tests because it’s required. Seniors require writing good tests – because they’ve seen what happens when
  you don’t.
    - See previous point. Also, the way of manual overview and testing should not differ that much: the main goal is to
      automate and outsource testing (to the computer). Creating tests that have no real use during development is far
      from being essential.


- Juniors hate technical debt. Seniors have written code that became technical debt (and know when to let it be and when
  to migrate).
    - An actively developed source code should not contain tech debt in order to make fast and easy changes. An actively
      developed source code will contain tech debt if not handled correctly.


- Juniors love to keep code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
  Seniors [Avoid Hasty Abstractions](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming).
    - Making forced abstractions will generate overcomplicated code bases. On the other hand, real code duplication
      should be avoided.


- Juniors try to write the best code the first time. Seniors understand code is read, moved, copied and deleted far more
  than it is written.
    - Also, a code will be used by someone. Creating bad interfaces and abstractions result in writing code on the same
      level, with the same functionality, which is far from creating something useful.


- Juniors know how to use their tools. Seniors know when not to use them.
    - Questions can be answered using tools. Taking a step back on the problem and asking the right question without
      using any tooling can be more beneficial occasionally.
      
# TODO

# Learning

- Juniors make one-off side projects. Seniors use their side projects daily, often to make themselves more productive at
  their day job.

- Juniors learn to find the right answers. Seniors learn to ask the right questions.

- Juniors know what they need to know. Seniors know what they don’t need to know.

- Juniors should absorb best practices from others. Seniors can derive best practices from first principles and personal
  pain.

- Juniors get stuck without docs and tutorials. Seniors aren’t afraid to read specs and view source.

- Juniors might have strongly held beliefs. Seniors have had to change strongly held beliefs.

- Juniors question themselves when they fail. Seniors know they just need to give themselves more time and try again.

- Juniors stay on top of news. Seniors keep track of trends. Junior Engineer, Senior Engineer 11

- Juniors try to avoid mistakes. Seniors have made them all – and know how to recover.

- Juniors laugh at software tropes. Seniors know there’s a grain of truth in all of them.

# Behavior

- Juniors seek The Best. Seniors love the Good Enough.

- Juniors should say “Yes” often. Seniors should say “No” more.

- Juniors should try to do the jobs they are given. Seniors should redesign their jobs as needed.

- Juniors complain about Open Source. Seniors understand Open Source only works thanks to contributors, not complainers.

- Juniors solve problems. Seniors identify problems before they become problems.

- Juniors start from what others say. Seniors start from what they need.

- Juniors know how to build. Seniors know when to buy.

- Juniors compare developer experience. Seniors look for hidden costs in user experience and in abstraction leaks.

- Juniors write as an afterthought. Seniors weigh writing as much as coding.

- Juniors leave comments. Seniors provide context.

# Team

- Juniors work within their teams. Seniors know when and how to work across teams.

- Juniors grow their own output. Seniors grow their team’s output.

- Juniors pair to learn best practices. Seniors pair to share expertise and see things in a new light.

- Juniors get roped in. Seniors get buy-in.

- Juniors must earn trust. Seniors inspire trust.

- Juniors seek out mentors. Seniors know how to learn from peers.

- Juniors work on improving themselves. Seniors work on improving their team, being a force multiplier through teaching,
  mentorship, and leadership.
